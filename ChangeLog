0.3:

- I re-wrote the method for managing raw IPv4 socket. Now you don't have to
manually specify a network interface anymore. If you won't, usock will look
for the first available, up and running network interface to be used.

- I inverted the fields 'TTL' and 'TotLen' in buildIPv4 function, as you
will most likely work on TTL field, than managing the IP's total length.

- I set a default parameter 'len=0' in RawSocket::read() method. If no length
is specified, the method will just read as many bytes as specified in the
eventual IP header (total length).
