uSock (formerely known as "MicroSock") is a high-level interface for managing
network sockets. The developer can manage sockets of different type and on
different levels (TCP or UDP client/server sockets, ICMP sockets, or raw
sockets), just using a few lines of C++ code. The library code will manage
sockets on a lower level, and will manage exceptions too.

Full HTML and LaTeX documentation (generated via Doxygen) is available in doc/
directory.

Some examples of use are also available in examples/ directory.

For installation instructions -> goto INSTALL.
